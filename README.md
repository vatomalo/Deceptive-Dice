# Deceptive-Dice
A fast-paced cinematic dice-duel game inspired by Seiken Densetsu 3, Samurai Shodown, and FFVII’s materia system, built entirely in JavaScript/Canvas. Every round is a mind-game: roll, clash, attack, evade, or pass using ninja-style repositioning. Weather, lighting, and dynamic FX make each duel feel alive.

Core Features
🎲 Dice-Driven Combat System

A custom 3×2 dice sprite engine with:

Physics: bounce arcs, wobble scale, timed stop

Auto-centered pips so every face is perfectly aligned

Cinematic “reveal → clash → attack” flow

Smoke FX that hides dice during roll and bursts on resolution

🗡️ 2D Action Animations

Uses a flexible Character system with:

Per-state sprite sheets (idle / run / attack / hurt / death)

Tween-based movement for smooth SNES-style pacing

Blink-teleport & shadow-clone FX for PASS maneuvers

⚔️ JRPG Enemy System (Revamped in v1.1)

Dynamic enemy generation with:

Four knight tiers (Novice → Champion)

Independent Enemy Level scaling with evolving STR/AGI/DEF

Random materia enhancements (counter, thorns, poison)

💠 Materia System (v1.1 Major Feature)

A full FF-style materia engine with:

Counter chance

Thorns damage

Poison application & ticking

Low-stamina flicker

Costs tied to PASS / ATTACK / dodge logic

🎨 Full Visual Pipeline

Parallax backgrounds with static & scrolling layers

Foreground & background decor buffers (Neo-Geo style layering)

Dynamic weather FX (sakura petals, pixel-rain, blended densities)

Weather Director for mood-based transitions (clear → sakura → heavy rain)

🔥 Combat FX System

Smoke, sparks, slashes, dust trails, teleport rings, angel-spark FX

All particle-driven, frame-stable, fully layered above combatants

Project Vision

Deceptive Dice aims to be a micro-JRPG with the intensity of an arcade fighting game, where:

every roll feels like a duel,

every attack is cinematic,

and the world feels alive through weather, light, and momentum.

The game is designed to scale into a full adventure mode with shops, materia crafting, enemy factions, and a world map system.
