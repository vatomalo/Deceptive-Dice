# Deceptive-Dice
A fast-paced cinematic dice-duel game inspired by Seiken Densetsu 3, Samurai Shodown, and FFVII’s materia system, built entirely in JavaScript/Canvas. Every round is a mind-game: roll, clash, attack, evade, or pass using ninja-style repositioning. Weather, lighting, and dynamic FX make each duel feel alive.
